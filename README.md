# HORIZON REACT FUN!

this is the tutorial for adding simple horizon functionality to a react app.

you'll need nodeJS and RethinkDB installed (let me know if you need help, or if any of this doesn't work).

- `npm install -g horizon`
- `hz serve --dev`

visit [http://localhost:8181](http://localhost:8181) (open in an incognito window too to test horizon functionality)

`dist/app-with-horizon.jsx` is the finished app file, you can use it as a guide!
